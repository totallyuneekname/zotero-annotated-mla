# zotero-annotated-mla
A collection of Citation Style Language (CSL) files meant to help Zotero users create annotated bibliographies

The annotated bibliography style will use any text under "note" as your annotation. In Zotero, this means putting your annotation under the "Extra" field. Unfortunately, Citation Style Language does not supper newlines, so if you want any you must add them manually after exporting your bibliography.
